# SIEM Internship Phase 3 - Advanced Threat Hunting & APT Simulation

## ðŸ”° Objective

In Phase 3 of the SIEM Internship, the objective was to simulate **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** scenarios and perform **threat hunting** using a layered detection approach. This phase focused on building real-world detection capabilities by simulating sophisticated attacks and analyzing them with tools like **Sysmon**, **Sigma Rules**, and the **ELK Stack**.

## ðŸ§ª Tasks Performed

### âœ… 1. Fileless Malware via PowerShell
- **Simulation**: Emulated a spear-phishing scenario that led to the remote execution of a malicious PowerShell payload.
- **Detection**:
  - Detected using **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation)** and **ID 10 (Script Events)**.
  - Obfuscated PowerShell and Base64 payload analysis performed.

### âœ… 2. Lateral Movement via RDP Brute Force
- **Simulation**: Low-privileged user used stolen credentials to brute-force RDP across servers.
- **Detection**:
  - Used `netstat`, `quser`, and `Sysmon Event ID 3 (Network Connections)`.
  - Brute-force login pattern identified via login attempt logs.

### âœ… 3. Persistence via Registry Run Keys
- **Simulation**: Registry keys were modified to maintain persistence on reboot.
- **Detection**:
  - Investigated changes using **Autoruns** and **Sysmon Event ID 13**.
  - Registry key path monitoring and modification alerts set up.

### âœ… 4. DNS Tunneling
- **Simulation**: Data was exfiltrated through DNS subdomain queries using encoded payloads.
- **Detection**:
  - Monitored outbound DNS traffic using **Wireshark** and **Zeek**.
  - Detected unusual domain length and entropy.

### âœ… 5. Credential Dumping via Mimikatz
- **Simulation**: Mimikatz used to dump credentials from LSASS and exfiltrate over HTTPS.
- **Detection**:
  - Detected using **Sysmon**, **Winlogbeat**, and **Sigma rules** for credential access.
